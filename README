to create a new image for bluemix, use wdpm
make sure you use the correct supervisord.conf
the program in the WDPM part needs the subdirectory path    /kafka_2.10-0.8.2.1/WDThread.py

The config/ directory should contain the server,properties files which indicate where to find zookeeper which depends on the IP addresses given by bluemix

You must also make sure that the WDThread.py and PMProcessor.py reflect which server you ar4e aiming at
